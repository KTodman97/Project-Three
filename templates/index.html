      <h2>Hypothesis & Project Description</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>
        <b>We hypothesize that there is a correlation between the consumption of healthy foods and the income level of households across the United States.</b>
        We will determine this correlation by analyzing the relationship between consumption, food types, and income levels. In our project, we'll generate 
        an interactive map that allows the user to select various objects such as different food types and income levels and in return, will display the consumption.
        We will showcase a map that displays the distance between low-income households and their accessibility to grocery stores within a given area. In addition,
        by measuring household income by commodity consumption we can gather a sound conclusion to either reject or accept our theory.

      <h2>United States Choropleth</h2>

      <div id = "map1"></div>
      <p>US Choropleth with updating layers based on user-click of one of the overlays. Each layer ranks the states by one of three factors: Median Income,
        Food Security, and Vegetable Consumption. Income data was pulled from the US Census; Food Security was pulled from the US Department of Agriculture;
        Vegetable Consumption survey was referenced from data compiled by America's Health Rankings (.org), a project from the United Health Foundation.
      </p> 
      <div id = "map2"></div>
      <p>According to the Dietary Guidelines for Americans, roughly half of adults in the United States suffer from one or more preventable chronic diseases 
        related to poor diet and physical inactivity. Diets high in fruits and vegetables reduce the risk of many chronic diseases such as cardiovascular disease, 
        type 2 diabetes and obesity. Vegetables contain essential vitamins and minerals and are an excellent source of fiber.
      </p>
      <div id = "map3"></div>
      <p>We wanted to create this comparison in order to show similarities between low-income states, food-insecure states, and low vegetable consumption.</p>

        <h3>Bar Chart of Food Consumption</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>The above chart shows the results of a study by the USDA that tracks the supply of food available for consumption in the United States and examines 
          consumer food preferences by consumersâ€™ census-gathered fingerprint.</p>
        <p>From this extensive dataset, we wanted to get a feeling for how certain "healthy" food groups compare to one another in terms of consumption. This 
          provides further context for the above Vegetable Consumption ranking map, by which we might be able to extrapolate the consumption of other necessary
          food groups. We chose to display Vegetables' ranking on the map because of the consistently low consumption of this food group compared to other food groups.

        <h3>Grouped Comparison of Food Consumption vs Income</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>Data gathered from USDA and Census data in the USDA's ERS study project.</p>
        <p>In this grouped bar chart, we wanted to compare the Food Consumption rank by income level, split into low versus high income. We feel this chart gives direct
          comparison to our hypothesis on a national level, that lower income potentially leads to unhealthy food consumption habits.
