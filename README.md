Technical Requirements:
Your visualization must include a Python Flask–powered RESTful API, HTML/CSS, * JavaScript, and at least one database (SQL, MongoDB, SQLite, etc.).
Your project should fall into one of the below four tracks:
*A custom “creative” D3.js project (i.e., a nonstandard graph or chart)
*A combination of web scraping and Leaflet or Plotly
*A dashboard page with multiple charts that update from the same data
*A “thick” server that performs multiple manipulations on data in a database prior to   visualization (must be approved)
Your project should include at least one JS library that we did not cover.
Your project must be powered by a data set with at least 100 records.
Your project must include some level of user-driven interaction (e.g., menus, dropdowns, textboxes).
Your final visualization should ideally include at least three views.

Possible D3.js libraries:
https://observablehq.com/@d3/density-contours Density Contours show complex relationships, potentially for Food Desert information.
https://observablehq.com/@d3/radial-stacked-bar-chart Radial Bar Chart to show specific food type consumption (versus some static category, like income?)
https://observablehq.com/@d3/bivariate-choropleth Bivariate Chloropleth to show relationship between two conditions (income on one axis and obesity? Nutrition? On the other)
